title: Advent of Code 2020
---

The [PuPPy](https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/) slack channel 
had a group of people doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 
I hadn't done this before, but decided to give it a go.

The programming challenges started out fairly easy, and it was
nice to code for an hour or two and get the satisfaction of
a little gold star for my effort. 

The problems increased
in difficulty over time, and some were seriously tricky and completed
over a couple of days. I definitely didn't come close to being
a speed "winner," (the global leaderboard winners solved them in 
minutes), but I did finish them all with varying 
levels of beauty and efficiency. 

It was a good chance to practice some odd corners of python
that I don't get to use that often and to do some "fun coding"
rather than "work coding."  I also tried reimplementing a few
of the problems involving tight loops to see how 
different approaches affect performance in python.
Overall, it was a nice payoff for a short-term commitment. 

Looking at the other repos from members of my peer slack channel, I think
a good new year's resolution might be to get a handle on type-hinted
python. My code seems to be "behind the times" without it.
