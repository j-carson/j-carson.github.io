title: I Have No Idea What I'm Doing
---

This blog was set up during my data science bootcamp, and they taught us "just enough to be
dangerous" about how to make it all work. 

When I decided maybe I should blog a bit, there were a lot of updates to apply, and it looks like there are a bunch
of interesting Jekyll features that weren't covered that I might want to experiement with in the future.

Which is just a fancy way of warning: "This blog is under construction" and things
may update randomly as I experiment some.
