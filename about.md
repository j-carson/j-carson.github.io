Hello world! This is a student blog for 
[Metis Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps).


When the instructors had the class set up our blog templates, I didn't have
a title in mind, so I just put "To Be Determined." I'll try to
come up with a clever name eventually, but I think this will do for now. 

Like anyone going through a career change, there's a chunk of my future that
is __To Be Determined__.

And I am __determined__ to finish the bootcamp and learn a lot 
about data science. Go Seattle Winter 2019 cohort! 

I'm your hostess, Janet Carson. I have a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) and an M.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu), but I have been out of the workforce for the last 20 years. Strangely, my fingers never forgot ```vi```. 

Welcome, and thanks for reading!
