Hello world! 

I'm your hostess, 
[Janet Carson.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carsondata)
I have a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences from 
[Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) and an M.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu). I worked as a 
lower-level software developer back in the Dark Ages, but left the 
workforce for an extended period of time to raise a family. 

I retrained at 
[Metis Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps) (go Seattle Winter 2019 cohort!)
to get some current technical skills (the world
changed, but my fingers never forgot ```vi```!) and now work
as a Data Engineer at [Echodyne](https://www.echodyne.com), processing and
analyzing data from radar field tests.

This started as my student blog for Metis, but now that I'm back working, it's been hard to keep it updated.
Data science bootcamps are a a great way to
get started, but you definitely can't learn everything in 12 weeks. I've picked up
a lot of new skills in the last year, but I haven't been blogging about
them. I'm going to try to get back here again, for my own benefit.

Welcome, and thanks for reading!
